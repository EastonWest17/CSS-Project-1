<p>Personality: Avery is the brawn and leader of the Agents. She is a battle fanatic and loves strong trainers. Avery’s humble exterior ironically belies a fearsome disposition though. She is prone to swift acts of violence and dealing out physical harm, often seen cracking her knuckles when she is angry or wants to intimidate. Despite her considerable aggressive nature, Avery is a remarkably warm, caring individual always willing to help those in need, especially children and younger brother, Ethan.</p>
