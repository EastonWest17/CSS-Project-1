<p>Personality: Zack is a very laid-back and chill person, who has a deep passion for music. However, he was generally not well-liked by his original team and he himself has openly admitted that he has no friends, is quite cowardly, lazy, womanizing, and has a habit to act selfishly. Despite his many flaws, Zack does possess a good side. After being transported to the Universe of the rest of the Agents, he finally tries to become more of a hero and helps the Agents, occasionally acting selfless, and even though still retaining some of his greedy and selfish nature, he contributes to saving the world with his new friends.</p>

    <h1>Grass<h1>
    <p>Ability: Grassy Surge</p> 
    <p>When Bonzo enters a battle, he releases a light-green ring of energy from his body onto the grass around him, powering up Grass-type moves.</p>   
    <p>Personality: Bonzo has a kind disposition and values harmony within any group he’s a part of. He is also passionate about making music with his trainer. Bonzo is very sensitive towards discord that could threaten the group's harmony and keeps a strict watch for such actions (most created by Zack, Ivo, or Lilith). Due to his strong sense of unity, Bonzo will ferociously defend his allies from trouble.</p>

<h1>BURST</h1>
<p>As a user of Burst, Ivo can use many of the abilities of the Pokémon he combines with Goliath, his Golisopod. This fusion gives Ivo extra armor, super strength, powerful slashing claws, 2 extra pairs of arms, and control over pressurized water that comes out of his body. </p>

    <h1>TECHNIQUES:</h1>
    
    <ul>Jungle Jam Session</ul>

    <ul>Solo Crowd Surf</ul>
    <ul>Zack plays a specific beat, activating Grassy Surge and creating Grassy Terrain. Zack then jumps off the drum and uses it as a surfboard, gliding towards the enemy and attacking them with a mighty punch.</ul>
