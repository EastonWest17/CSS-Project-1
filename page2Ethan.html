<h1>BURST</h1>

    <h1>TECHNIQUES:</h1>
    
    <ul>Shadow Shrouds: Super Surf Strike</ul>

    <ul>Shadow Shrouds: True Water Shuriken</ul>
    <ul>After using Shadow Shrouds, Ethan creates an army of clones to assault his opponent, overwhelming them by attacking all sides with Acrobatics. While this happens, the real Ethan is charging a giant Surf, so powerful the water sharpens into a gigantic shuriken. As a final attack, the shrouds trap the foe in a dogpile as Ethan throws the shuriken, slashing through the clones, hitting and carrying its target into the air before exploding in a large water vortex.</ul>
    <ul>Surf: Traditional</ul>
    <ul>Ethan uses Surf and slams the water orb into the ground, creating a large wave. The wave crashes down on the opponent.</ul>
    <ul>Surf: Traditional: Shuriken Salvo</ul>
    <ul>Ethan uses Surf and slams the water orb into the ground, creating a large wave that rockets towards the opponent. This wave fires swathes of water shurikens at them as well.</ul>
