<h1>Pokémon:</h1>    
    <img src="assets/Charizard.png" height="200px" width="200px">
    <h1>Charizard♂<h1>
    <h1>“Ran”<h1>
    <h1>Fire/Flying<h1>
    <p>Ability: Blaze</p> 
    <p>When Ran becomes weak or tired, his body becomes surrounded by a fiery aura, powering up his Fire-type attacks.</p>   
    <p>Personality:Ran is carefree and reckless in nature, he is a fiercely loyal and protective friend. He is willing to go down fighting for his friends, regardless of how futile it might seem. Ran has a straightforward mind and often tackles issues with a "hands-on" approach. His solution to problems often involves violence.</p>
<table>
<h1>MOVES:</h1>

<p>Flamethrower (Fire)</p>
<p>Ran releases a red-orange stream of fire from his mouth at the opponent.</p>
<p>Thunder Punch (Electric)</p>
<p>Ran's fists and body become outlined by yellow electricity. Charizard then punches the opponent with one of his fists.</p>
<p>Bulldoze (Ground)</p>
<p>Ran's body becomes surrounded by an orange aura. He then stomps on the ground and creates an orange ring of aura pulsating from where he stomped, causing the ground to shake.</p>
<p>Sky Attack (Flying)</p>
<p>Ran's body becomes surrounded by a gradually intensifying light blue aura. Once the aura flares up, Ran flies into the opponent at top speed. The longer Ran charges, the more damage it does.</p>

<h1>BURST</h1>
<p>As a user of Burst, Hugo can use many of the abilities of the Pokémon he combines with Ran, his Charizard. Fusing with Ran gives Hugo the ability to fly with his wings, fire manipulation, and powerful claws.</p>

    <h1>TECHNIQUES:</h1>
    
    <ul>Raging Flame Rush</ul>
    <ul>Hugo uses Flamethrower while flying at an opponent. His body becomes enveloped in fire and he then uses Sky Attack to buff the effects. He then collides with the enemy, causing a powerful fiery explosion.</ul>
    <ul>Sea of Hellblaze</ul>
    <ul>Hugo quickly flies up to an enemy and grabs them, carrying them high into the sky. He then uses Flamethrower down on the ground to create a wildfire. He then throws the enemy into it following up with an even more powerful Flamethrower.</ul>
    <ul>Heaven’s Flare</ul>
    <ul>This only works if Hugo has the Blaze ability activated. After taking many up close and personal attacks, Hugo uses his wings to slap both sides of the opponent's head, stunning them. He then grabs them by the throat and unleashes a white-hot powerful Flamethrower at close range, absolutely obliterating them.</ul>
